Hey guys!
Soooo.. I went down to the prep school on Monday to talk to the year 5's because Hugh wasn't there. On my little expenditure I had this idea and I need your opinions. 
I was thinking we could contact a primary school in another English speaking country and organise for a video conference between them and some of the prep students. The prep students won't know where the other school is from and vice -versa, and by asking questions they have to guess which country they are from. After this I was thinking that they could exchange letters and all have their own designated penpal/s. We should aim at getting them to group call once or twice a term. 
Its just an idea but let me know what you all think!

Thanks, 
Georgia :)
